-- | Machine Learning

    Prerequisites:
      -- | Duration of preparation [ how much time until `Initial` ]
         | https://www.coursera.org/course/ml 
         | also benefits from significant mathematical knowledge 

         - 2 year@15 hour weeks estimate for non-phD positions 

      -- | Cost :: difference, if any, in wealth of pursuing until `Initial` opposed to status quo
         - books and a special machine or two 10K

    Initial:
      -- | How competitive the field is
      
         - super open : lots of varied positions. Some require phD's
      -- | Expected starting income

         - varied 60K - 120K With some outliers like really evil data mining for big corps getting the 120 - 150 K realm 
      -- | Time requirement [ as in 40 hours per week ]

         - 60 hours a week for quite a bit. But some more academia stuff like pattern rec is smaller. Of course those require PHD
      -- | spatial requirement [ how important moving would be ]

         - Move would be required unless found around here.

    Endurance
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
      
         - Extremely stable except for robotics which would be job by job.
      -- | Personal satisfaction [ i.e. anesthesiologist vs soup kitchen ]
         - low satisfaction for mining but high for others


-- | Computing Architectures

    -- don't even need the details -- Unless I take the  bill gates route 
    these are only available to PhD's. 

-- | Distributed systems for computation
    Prerequisites:
      -- | Duration of preparation [ how much time until `Initial` ]
         | Much is extant for me: General network and parellel computation concepts. 
         | even my nascent Haskell knowledge has increased these understandings
         - 1 year @ 15 hour weeks

      -- | Cost :: difference, if any, in wealth of pursuing until `Initial` opposed to status quo
         | Some -- would need additional machines and some significant WAN machines
         - ~10 thousand a year in cost I think.
    Initial:
      -- | How competitive the field is
         | very, but is in high demand : see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_projects
         - Also most projects appear to be on the edges { either excellent or shit }
      -- | Expected starting income
         | nobody knows [ http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Distributed-Computing-Analyst-l-Minneapolis,-MN.html]  trend is all over the place.
         - likely starting at 80K but initial success in this area will gain huge dollars
      -- | Time requirement [ as in 40 hours per week ]
         - to new to know: probably very high initially
      -- | spatial requirement [ how important moving would be ]
         - generally not important and certainly not for years. Would go into business as 
         a consultant initally.

    Endurance
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
         - this concept is the future -- but it has been "the future" since 1960 and hasn't really gained huge traction. Ubiquitous fast networks make it significantly more realistic than it was even 5 years ago
      -- | Personal satisfaction [ i.e. anesthesiologist vs soup kitchen ]
         - I think high, but since few people but researchers have really done anything here
         it is hard to find personal stories

-- | BioMedical analysis and data storage
    Prerequisites:
      -- | Duration of preparation [ how much time until `Initial` ]
         | 1 year @ more dedicated pace : like 25 hours a week
         | 2 years @ 15 hours a week. 
         | crush is possible b/c of : http://www.osirix-viewer.com/
         | an open source project I can simply read the code of.
         | I could also contribute code to that for credentials.

         - 1 to 2 years
      -- | Cost :: difference, if any, in wealth of pursuing until `Initial` opposed to status quo
         - high, like 20K for parts and hardware to learn on.

    Initial:
      -- | How competitive the field is
         - not competitive and required all over the world
      -- | Expected starting income
         - Very high: 120K - 135K
      -- | Time requirement [ as in 40 hours per week ]
         - fits and starts. Massive 80 hour week requirements then nothing. Sounds like it is similar to being a trucker
      -- | spatial requirement [ how important moving would be ]
         - Don't have to move, but would travel for extended periods [ jobs ] frequently. Like 3 - 6 months at places

    Endurance
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
         - long term stability, short term totally erratic 
      -- | Personal satisfaction [ i.e. anesthesiologist vs soup kitchen ]
         - actully pretty low: and high stress because if your shit is wrong people die

    Endurance
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
         - Short term stable : like 5 - 7 years. Then a new job would be needed. Also low room for advancement but that is changing
      -- | Personal satisfaction [ i.e. anesthesiologist vs soup kitchen ]
     - If I didn't have direct contact with customers, than high


-- | Web Development

    Prerequisites:
      -- | Duration of preparation [ how much time until `Initial` ]
         | some techs are already under the belt -- learning Yesod would be key
         - 1 year @ 15 hours a week
      -- | Cost :: difference, if any, in wealth of pursuing until `Initial` opposed to status quo
         - 0

    Initial:
      -- | How competitive the field is
         | quite but it is all over the place
         - oddly my "hard" tech is both a benefit and a deficit
      -- | Expected starting income
         - also all over the place 60K -> 90K
      -- | Time requirement [ as in 40 hours per week ]
         - 40 hours but fits and starts. May do best as self employ
      -- | spatial requirement [ how important moving would be ]
         - not at all

    Endurance
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
         - not stable; save, maybe, for self employ
      -- | Personal satisfaction [ i.e. anesthesiologist vs soup kitchen ]
         - depends on what companies I work with nearly entirely

-- | High Assurance software [ medical hardware and other embedded ]
    Prerequisites:
      -- | Duration of preparation [ how much time until `Initial` ]
         | Long because of complex training: expert systems, formal methods etc
         | A lot of these also require DOD clearance 
         - 3 years@15 hour weeks
      -- | Cost :: difference, if any, in wealth of pursuing until `Initial` opposed to status quo
         | Just some books and small electronics
         - 10 K

    Initial:
      -- | How competitive the field is
         - I cannot tell : seems quite competitive but also welcoming
      -- | Expected starting income
         - Very high 200K area
      -- | Time requirement [ as in 40 hours per week ]
         - couldn't tell but likely not huge.
      -- | spatial requirement [ how important moving would be ]
         - would have to go to place of business no matter what.

    Endurance
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
         - super super stable
      -- | Personal satisfaction [ i.e. anesthesiologist vs soup kitchen ]
         | high if I did something good, and low if evil
         - unfortunately most available positions are mega evil so: low

-- | Game design
    Prerequisites:
      -- | Duration of preparation [ how much time until `Initial` ]
         | Long: I don't know 3d graphics, but could do simple [ open source ] games

      -- | Cost :: difference, if any, in wealth of pursuing until `Initial` opposed to status quo
         | special hardware and test environments:
         - 5K a year

    Initial:
      -- | How competitive the field is
         - Very fucking competative :: but there is space and major respect for those 
           that make a name
      -- | Expected starting income
         - 70K
      -- | Time requirement [ as in 40 hours per week ]
         - short bursts of massive, like 80 hour weeks, but then very chill periods
      -- | spatial requirement [ how important moving would be ]
         | only somewhat: many studios have multiple locations and "work" from home
         | people -- but much of the big studio code is under lock and key so only 
         | available in the office
         - Maybe have to move


    Endurance:
      -- | Expected Stability of job [ is it consultant like, or would I stay at a company for years and years ]
         - unstable `job` stable `career` once you've a name
